To copy iterators you must use tee(), because copy doesn't work for
reasosons...

Tracing (python -m trace -t sneaking_at_powerseries.py | grep sneaking)
shows that there is too much recursion, this can me improved by
implemeting mulc() whith map, that is implemented is an iterative
way internaly, and implementing things like add() with zip() and
starmap() with add(), and the same can be done for sub().
