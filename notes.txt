To copy iterators you must use tee(), because copy doesn't work for
reasosons...

The Fraction() class can be used to get nicer results.

Tracing (python -m trace) shows that there is too much recursion,
this can me improved by implemeting mulc() whith map, that is
implemented is an iterative way internaly, and implementing things
like add() with zip() and starmap() with add(), and the same can
be done for sub().

Add sin/cos = tan identity to the tests and similar functions with
the Taylor series.
